   <center><b><p>Independence Day in the Philippines, also known as 
    "Araw ng Kalayaan," is a national holiday celebrated on June 12th each 
    year. It commemorates the Philippines' declaration of independence from 
    Spanish colonial rule on June 12, 1898. The declaration was made by General
     Emilio Aguinaldo, who proclaimed Philippine independence in Kawit, Cavite,
      following the Filipino victory in the Battle of Alapan.</p></b></center></div>

        <center><b><p>During Independence Day celebrations, various activities
             take place across the country, including flag-raising ceremonies, 
             parades, cultural performances, historical reenactments, and patriotic 
             displays. These events serve to honor the sacrifices of Filipino heroes
