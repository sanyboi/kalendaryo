   <center><b><p>Maundy Thursday is the Christian holy day that commemorates the
     Last Supper of Jesus Christ with his disciples, as described in the New Testament 
     of the Bible. It falls on the Thursday before Easter Sunday and is part of the Holy Week observances
      leading up to Easter. The word "Maundy" is derived from the Latin word "mandatum," meaning "commandment," referring to Jesus' 
      commandment to his disciples to love one another as he loved them. Traditionally, Maundy Thursday services may include the reenactment 
      of the Last Supper, the washing of feet (symbolizing humility and service), and the celebration of the Eucharist or Holy Communion. 
      It is a solemn and reflective day for many Christians, marking the beginning of the Easter Triduum, which includes Good Friday and Holy Saturday.</p></b></center></div>
