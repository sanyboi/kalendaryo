   <center><b><p>Good Friday is the Christian holy day that commemorates the 
    crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. It falls on the Friday
     before Easter Sunday and is part of the Holy Week observances. Good Friday 
     is a solemn day of reflection and mourning for many Christians, as they
      contemplate the sacrifice of Jesus for the forgiveness of sins. It is 
      typically marked by church services, scripture readings, prayers, and 
      devotional reflections on the suffering and death of Jesus.</p></b></center></div>
