   <center><b><p>Rizal Day is a national holiday in the Philippines observed on 
    December 30th each year. It commemorates the life and martyrdom of Dr. José 
    Rizal, a prominent Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary hero.</p></b></center></div>

        <center><b><p>José Rizal was a key figure in the Philippine Revolution against
             Spanish colonial rule. He used his writings and intellectual prowess to 
             inspire Filipinos to seek independence and advocate for social reforms. 
             Rizal's novels, such as "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," exposed
              the injustices and abuses of the Spanish colonial government, sparking a
               sense of national consciousness and awakening among Filipinos.<p></b></center>
      </div>
      <div>
        <center><b><p>Rizal Day is a time for Filipinos to honor José Rizal's 
            contributions to the Philippine struggle for independence and to reflect
             on his ideals of patriotism, selflessness, and love of country. It is 
             observed with various activities, including wreath-laying ceremonies at 
             Rizal Park (formerly Luneta Park) in Manila, where Rizal was executed by 
             firing squad in 1896. </p></b></center>
