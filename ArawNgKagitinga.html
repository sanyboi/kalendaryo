   <center><b><p>"Araw ng Kagitingan" is a Filipino term that translates to
     "Day of Valor" in English. It is a national holiday observed in the 
     Philippines on April 9th each year. Araw ng Kagitingan commemorates the 
     heroism and sacrifice of Filipino and American soldiers during the Battle
      of Bataan in World War II. This battle, which took place in 1942, was a
       significant event in Philippine history, marking the defense of Bataan
        against Japanese forces during the early stages of the war. The holiday 
        serves as a reminder of the bravery and resilience of those who fought
         and suffered during this period. It also honors the memory of those who
          lost their lives in defense of freedom and democracy.</p></b></center></div>
